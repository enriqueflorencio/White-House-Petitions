# White-House-Petitions
An app that displays white house petitions that are most recent and top rated. Users are allowed to filter petitions based on what they want to see. The goal of this project was to learn how API's function and parse data retrieved from them. Also, learning how to use Apple's GCD framework to have tasks running in the background and main thread was another goal.
